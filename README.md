Natural Language Processing Algorithms and Concepts.
## Identify gene names with Hidden Markov Model (HMMs)
  A trigram hidden Markov model to identify gene names in biological texts.
## A probabilistic CKY parser
  The program determines the most probable syntactic analysis and outputs the associated parse tree.

## Perceptron
  As a basics for Neural Network, I have implemented a perceptron network for Identifying gene names as done before using the Hidden Markov model.
